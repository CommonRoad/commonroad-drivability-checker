CommonRoad Drivability Checker
------------------------------

Collision avoidance, kinematic feasibility, and road-compliance must be 
validated to ensure the drivability of planned motions for autonomous 
vehicles. The CommonRoad Drivability Checker toolbox unifies these checks 
in order to simplify the development and validation of motion planning 
algorithms. It is compatible with the CommonRoad benchmark suite, which 
additionally facilitates and drastically reduces the effort of the development
of motion planning algorithms.

#### CommonRoad Drivability Checker: Simplifying the Development and Validation of Motion Planning Algorithms
Christian Pek, Vitaliy Rusinov, Stefanie Manzinger, Murat Can Üste, and Matthias Althoff

Abstract— Collision avoidance, kinematic feasibility, and road-compliance must be validated to ensure the drivability
of planned motions for autonomous vehicles. Although these tasks are highly repetitive, computationally efficient 
toolboxes are still unavailable. The CommonRoad Drivability Checker—an open-source toolbox—unifies these mentioned 
checks. It is compatible with the CommonRoad benchmark suite, which additionally facilitates the development of motion 
planners. Our toolbox drastically reduces the effort of developing and validating motion planning algorithms. Numerical 
experiments show that our toolbox is real-time capable and can be used in real test vehicles.
