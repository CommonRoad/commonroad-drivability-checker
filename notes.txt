Permission is hereby granted to use the commonroad-drivability-checker under the terms of the Modified BSD license provided that the license requirements for optional plugins and dependencies are also met.

Running 'git submodule update', 'bash build.sh' as well as installing the library begins the download of the third-party Triangle library. 
Please note that the Triangle library can not be used for commercial projects. See license conditions for the Triangle library at https://github.com/libigl/triangle/blob/master/triangle.c  or https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html for details. It can be substituted with the CGAL library for polygon triangulation.

Installing the library begins the download of the third-party Polygon3 python package. Please note that the Polygon3 python package can not be used for commercial projects. Please see its license details at https://www.j-raedler.de/projects/polygon/

You could optionally modify the library to use a plugin for fast triangulation of polygons which uses the CGAL library (https://www.cgal.org/). Please see its license details.
To do so, CGAL needs to be installed, and in line 4 of the file cpp/collision/src/plugins/triangulation/triangulate.cc 0 needs to be replaced with 1.
